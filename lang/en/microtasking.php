            Every repair tells a story.  Ever since our first Restart Party, we\'ve believed that combining these stories
            could tell us more about the world than any inidividual repair.  So, from day one we started recording 
            every repair we attempted. 
       </p>
       <p>
           Over the years we\'ve build Restarters.net for everyone to store this data and analyse the impact of repairs.
           We\'ve worked with allies to create an open standard for recording repairs and made data tools available to communities
           around the world.  And our insights have helped shape new Right to Repair laws in Europe.
       </p>
       <p>
            <strong>You, our community</strong> have played a vital role at every stage, from recording repair data,
            to completing online microtasks, to showing up at protests.  So, <strong>we\'re absolutely delighted
            to tell you that we have all been awarded the European Unition Prize for Citizen Science - Digital 
            Communities Award! <a href="https://therestartproject.org/data-and-insights/we-won-the-european-union-prize-for-citizen-science-digital-communities-award">Learn more</a>.
