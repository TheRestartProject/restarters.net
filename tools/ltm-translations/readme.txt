READ THE CODE!!

THIS IS ONLY A VERY ROUGH GUIDE!

Run the query in file `query.sql`
Export to file `todo.csv`
Enter api key into deeplapi.php
Execute deeplapi.php
Export the results in `done.csv` to a Google sheet for review
Re-import to `done.csv` (or another csv file)


EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING ONLY ON A STAGING INSTANCE!!!
Execute ltm_merge.php
execute php artisan translations:export and commit files
