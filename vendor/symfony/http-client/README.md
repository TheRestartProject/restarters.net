The Httpclient component for Symfony 6.1 is [backed][1] by [Prisma Media][2].

Prisma Media has become in 40 years the n°1 French publishing group, on print and
digitally, with 20 flagship brands of the news magazines : Femme Actuelle, GEO,
Capital, Gala or Télé-Loisirs… Today, more than 42 million French people are in
contact with one of our brand each month, either by leafing through a magazine,
surfing the web, subscribing one our mobile or tablet application or listening to
our podcasts' series. Prisma Media has successfully transformed one's business
model : from a historic player in the world of paper, it has become in 5 years
one of the first publishers of multi-media editorial content, and one of the
first creators of digital solutions.
