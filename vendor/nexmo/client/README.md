# Nexmo PHP Complete Package

This package is a wrapper for our PHP library, which you can find here: <https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-php>

This package exists to separate the Nexmo functionality from the HTTP Client. If you can't install this package due to a conflict with the `guzzle6-adapter` package, you can instead install:

* The main package `nexmo/client-core`
* Any HTTP client that satisfies `php-http/client-implementation` (see <https://packagist.org/providers/php-http/client-implementation> for options).
