# Fixometer

The Fixometer is our tool to monitor the growing impact of our community repair activities and those of our network of partners. It allows members of the Restart community to log fixes occurring at the events they run, capturing the environmental and social impact of their work.  To find out more visit [the Fixometer page on our website](https://therestartproject.org/fixometer/).

## Creating issues

Please do get involved and create [Issues](https://github.com/TheRestartProject/Fixometer/issues) if you encounter any, or if you have any thoughts on how the Fixometer could work for you.  You'll need a Github account in order to create an issue.  Don't worry about categorising them - we will take care of that.

## Tech

The tool is built in PHP/MySQL, MVC architecture. The tool's frontend is managed and buit with Bower/Grunt (see /public). Frontend built upon Bootstrap.

### Installation

See [Installation Guidelines](../../wiki/Installation-Guidelines) in the wiki.

## Methodology
We've documented our method for estimating CO2 emissions prevented through electronic repairs. Please read more at http://rstrt.org/FAQ

## Funding and future development
The first version of the tool (2015) was made possible with modest funding from the Innovation in Waste Prevention Fund, Defra-funded and administered by WRAP. Subsequent development has been financed by the Shuttleworth Foundation.
