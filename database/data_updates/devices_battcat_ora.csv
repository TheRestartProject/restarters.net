restart_15853,The Restart Project,GBR,Hi-Fi integrated ~ Radiogram,Hi-Fi integrated,HMV,1959,Repairable,2019-11-16,"16th Nov 2019 item29: HMV valve radiogram chassisThis was a very old radiogram chassis pre 1960's using valves (no transistors or FETs!). First comment is that these are dangerous with high voltages on exposed parts (300-400V and sometimes higher so if you do not understand how they work and cannot identify danger areas DO NOT DABBLE!!Second comment is that this repair is not something to do at a repair cafe event unless you can guarantee no-one but yourself can touch anything either accidentally or deliberately.I took the chassis home:- step 1, get the service manual- step 2, clean the dust off and check correct valves in place and look for failed components - old capacitors are typical failures. They become leaky and loose their capacitance.All seemed remarkably well given the age!One valve was incorrect and removed. This left 2 missing valves. They were in fact the push pull audio output stage valves type HN309. These are somewhat unusual as they have a 12.6V heater - my hunch is that they were used in old valve car radios operating from a 12V battery. HN309 are triode/pentodes (2 valves in one) and like rocking horse you know what to find but after some investigation I found a very similar type LN309 and further cross referencing identified a more common PCL83 as a potential alternative after comparing specs (see here at the Valve Museum for valve information  http://www.r-type.org/)- step 3, Decided to fit a modern mains lead - the old leads were not in a good state.- step 4, I performed a 250V insulation test on the mains transformer and also between primary and secondary windings (looking for breakdown of the enamel coating on windings) - all was well. In this case I repeated at 500V and again all was well. Also checked mains switch wiring was working using a multimeter switched to measure resistance. Again all was well, particularly no shorts. - step 5, I decided to switch on!! even with 2 valves missing. Switching on was performed at the mains socket, with the unit on/off switch already set to on.No nast",en,"16th Nov 2019 item29: HMV valve radiogram chassisThis was a very old radiogram chassis pre 1960's using valves (no transistors or FETs!).

Ein Ladegerät mit amerikanischer Norm (110V/60Hz) konnte mangels Trafo nicht getestet werden und das zweite Netzteil gab kein Lebenszeichen mehr von sich. Da es nicht zerstörungsfrei zerlegt werden konnte, ließen wir es lieber ungeöffnet.",de,"We could not test the function due to a deep discharged Li-Ion batteries. A charger with American standard (110V / 60Hz) could not be tested due to lack of power supply and the second power supply was no signs of life from him. Since it could not be dismantled without destruction, we left it rather unopened."
