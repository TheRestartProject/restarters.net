Feature: Group Impact Analysis
    As a Host
    In order to be able to showcase the work of my Group
    I want to see an impact analysis of my Group's Events

Group hosts are able to get reports about the impact of individual Restart
Parties: total of waste prevented, CO2 emissions prevented, hours
volunteered.

Group hosts are also able to get an an aggregate total of all waste
prevented, CO2 emissions prevented, hours volunteered for the
entirety of their groupâ€™s events.

TODO: Add larger dataset test and checking the algorithms.
