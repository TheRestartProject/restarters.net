Feature: 1 Vision

The Fixometer is a data collection and visualisation tool that lets repair
organisations easily and conveniently collect information on repairs, and
visualise the impact of those repairs.

The Fixometer fits into the Restart Project's vision of changing the world's
relationship with electronics, by providing a platform for the collection of
open repair data. It was the initial phase of our development of the open repair
data standard, which will allow for open repair data to be collected and pooled
together from multiple organisations using different tools. The Fixometer
continues to be developed as the flagship and archetype tool for open repair
data collection.
