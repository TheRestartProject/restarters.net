Feature: 4 Glossary

Event (AKA Restart Party)
: Free community electronics repair event. People join us to fix their broken
electronics. At events, Restart Party Hosts log the status of devices, and
afterwards feed into our online database.

Participant AKA Owner
: A participant is someone who brings a device to an event for repair.
Who comes to events? People who are frustrated with our throwaway culture,
people who cannot afford to buy new, people who are curious to get inside
their black-box gadgets. In our experience, an equal number of men and women
bring gadgets for repair, and participants come from all walks of life.

Device (AKA item)
: Devices are brought to events in order to be fixed.
What is a device? A wide range of items from laptops through to toasters.
Devices are categorised into device categories.

Device categories.
: There are 34 device categories.

Category cluster.
: Devices categories are split into four clusters: computers and home office,
electronic gadgets, home entertainment, kitchen and household items.

Repairers AKA Restarters.
: We call our volunteer repairers "Restarters". They are talented amateurs,
with various backgrounds and experience. Owners get involved in the repair,
helping troubleshoot, disassemble and sometimes fix their own electronics.

Calculations
: For each category we maintain data on the average weight; data on how
repaired devices displace new devices (which is where the environmental
benefit comes in); and data on the carbon footprint to manufacture each type
of electrical device.

Representative products
: A product which we deem to be representative of a particular category.

Average weight
: We used the Furniture Reuse Network’s 2009 data as a starting point, updated
some figures, and sourced more online, as averages of representative products.

Displacement rate
: The rate by which we prevent a new manufacture. Our biggest – and most
necessary – assumption is that a fix at a Restart Party displaces a new
manufacture by 50%. That is, that a repaired device will live on for an extra
50% more than its intended life.

Carbon footprint
: The amount of carbon required to manufacture each type of electrical device.

Data quality indicators
: Data quality indicators are used in carbon footprinting to ensure that the
accuracy of each datapoint is understood and transparent.

Repairability
: Many devices leave a Restart Party that seem worthy of more effort.
Some need spare parts that we don’t have at our immediate disposal.
Sometimes device owners go home ready to finish the job themselves – this
occurs in about 4.6% of cases. Others are referred to professional repairers.
These are recorded as “repairable”.

End-of-life
: A device is labelled "end-of-life" when a Restarter and the owner decide it
is not cost-effective or realistic to repair the device.

Reuse opportunity
: We encourage owners of end-of-life devices to seek out a reuse opportunity
before taking them to be recycled. This is the most resource-efficient option.
Many devices can be sold or given away for parts. But ultimately, we would like
to see devices recycled so that their materials can be recovered.

Types of fixes
: There can be software fixes or hardware fixes.
Many of our fixes are software related. Issues related to software contribute
to a feeling of "perceived obsolescence", and motivate an owner of a device to
abandon it, when a simple software fix can address the frustrations of a user
and prolong the lifecycle of a gadget. In fact, often times mobiles, tablets
and laptops can refuse to boot due to software problems. With laptops,
software fixes are just as common as hardware ones.

Fix frequency
: The total amount of times particular devices are fixed at our events.
Devices that are *brought* frequently may have a high fix frequency.
Laptops, mobiles, and small kitchen items are brought frequently and as a
result have a high fix frequency.

Fix rates
: Different from the fix frequency, this is the ratio that devices brought to
event ends up being fixed vs not fixed. The fix rate could then be an indicator
of repairability of a particular category (although other factors, such as skill
sets of repairers, also have a factor.) Musical instruments, toys, headphones
and lamps have high fix rates. Flat screens and heating/cooling appliances have
low fix rates (however they are not that frequently brought to events.)
We also have trouble with PC accessories like mice, keyboards, and computer
speakers, kettles, decorative and/or safety lights.

Spare parts
: 18.8% of repairs require spare parts. In exceptional cases, especially for
screen repairs, participants bring the parts with them and we are able to fix
the device on the spot. Most require follow-up by the device owner.
Spare parts for some devices and categories of devices are found for sale
online.
