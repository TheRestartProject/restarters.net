Feature: View global impact
  
In order to feel enthused about the importance of repair
As a repair volunteer
I want to see the global impact of repairs within Restarters

Scenario:
  Given I am any user
  When I visit the Fixometer page
  Then I see the Our Global Impact section

(positioned at the top, as per new designs, but layout the same as current designs - https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/FVUY2NBSJAK#/screens/395779660)
