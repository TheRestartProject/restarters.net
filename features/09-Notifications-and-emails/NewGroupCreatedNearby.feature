Feature: Notification of new group created nearby
  
As an unaffiliated volunteer
In order to find repair groups that I can volunteer with
I want to be notified when a new group is created near me

When a new group is created, volunteers within 25 miles of the newly created group are sent a notification, to let them know that the new group has been created.

If the volunteer has opted in to receive email notifications, they will also be sent an email notification.
