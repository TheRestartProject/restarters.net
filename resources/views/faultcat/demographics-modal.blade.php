                    We’re asking for some basic information about your age and where you’re based to help us understand the social impact of our work.
                </p>
                <p>
                The community events that produced the repair data you’re seeing are not only great for the environment, but can also help bring people together and build stronger communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                As part of this, we’re trying to encourage volunteer activity among people who are 50 or over and based in England.
                </p>
                <p>
                The recorded information is collected purely for demographic analysis and we won’t share it with anyone.
                </p>
