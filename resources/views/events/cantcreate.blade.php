          <p><strong>Not a host?</strong> You can view already listed events for any groups that you're following, and other events near you, on the <a href="/group">Events</a> page.
              <br>(If an event is missing, please encourage the group host to list it!)
          </p>

          <p><strong>Want to add a group that you host?</strong>  Check whether it's already listed on the <a href="/group">Groups</a> page - and if not, please create it!</p>
