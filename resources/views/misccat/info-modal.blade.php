                    MiscCat is a web app to help categorise the type of items brought to community events</strong> such as Restart Parties and Repair Cafes.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    Volunteers collect data about the items that are brought into our repair events. The data is uploaded to Restarters.net and shared as <a target="_blank" href="https://openrepair.org/open-data/downloads">open data</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where you can help, by playing MiscCat!
