                    MobiFix is a web app to help <strong>collaboratively categorise the type of faults in smartphones brought to community events</strong> such as Restart Parties and Repair Cafes.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    Volunteers collect data about the devices that are brought into our repair events. The data is uploaded to Restarters.net and shared as <a target="_blank" href="https://openrepair.org/open-data/downloads">open data</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>To enable community repair to contribute to upcoming policy discussions on the right to repair for smartphones</strong>, we want to see what types of faults are commonly encountered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So weâ€™d like to analyse the data collected so far, to learn about key faults seen at repair events - and this is where you can help, by playing MobiFix!
                </p>
